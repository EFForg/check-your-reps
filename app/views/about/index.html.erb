      <h1>What We Mean When We Say Someone Is
For Net Neutrality</h1>
<p>Net neutrality is an idea that is vital to the
health of the free and open Internet we all rely
upon. That’s one of the reasons the FCC’s
repeal of net neutrality was so unpopular. And
that’s why you can and should continue to
fight for it.
Net neutrality is so well-loved that even its
opponents are paying it lip service, which
makes it important to separate actual support
from cynical name-dropping. Sometimes
that’s easy: it’s a good bet that AT&T, a major
ISP who stands to make a lot of money by
undermining net neutrality, isn’t actually
standing up for it, for example. Sometimes it’s
hard: politicians can often craft messages and
legislation that say one thing and mean
another.
Net neutrality means that Internet service
providers (ISPs) should treat all data that
travels over their networks fairly, without
improper discrimination in favor of particular
apps, sites or services. It means a ban on
blocking data. It means a ban on throttling the
download and upload speeds on particular
data. And it means a ban on paid prioritization,
where an ISP charges content providers to get
better or faster or more consistent access to
the ISP’s customer or give such perks to its
own content over a competitor’s.
It’s principles like these that make up real net
neutrality, and that is what we’re looking to
Congress to support. On this site, we’re making
sure to track concrete promises to act to save
net neutrality rather than mere general
statements of support in for the principle ̧ or
support for bogus bills masquerading as
protection for net neutrality but not including
real protections.
The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows
Congress to overturn the FCC’s repeal of the
2015 Open Internet Order—which did a lot of
work to ensure real net neutrality. A pledge to
vote for that is an act that will actually go a
long way to preserving a free and open
Internet. In the Senate, Sen. Ed Markey’s CRA
resolution already has 51 votes. We want the
House of Representatives to follow suit and
have a majority pledging to vote to repeal the
FCC’s order.
That action is what this website tracks. It’s a
clear, concrete thing you can ask your
representatives to do.
